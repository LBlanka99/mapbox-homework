## About the project
![About The Project Screenshot][screenshot]

This is a simple web application that allows users to interact with a Mapbox map.
The application lets users place markers on the map, plan routes between markers, and customize route appearance.
The default map view centers on Veszpr√©m, Hungary.

### Features
- **Interactive Map:** The application displays an interactive Mapbox map, allowing users to interact with it.
- **Mouse Wheel Zoom:** Users can zoom in and out of the map by scrolling the mouse wheel, allowing for a dynamic and detailed exploration of the map.
- **Place Markers:** Users can click on the map to place markers. The application limits the number of markers to a maximum of 25.
- **Plan Routes:** Users can plan routes between markers on foot, by car or by bike using the Mapbox Directions API. The following route information is displayed:
  - Route geometry on the map
  - Route distance and estimated travel time
- **Searchable Geocoding:** A search feature is implemented to search for locations and add markers to the map using address searches.
- **Customize Route Appearance:** Users can customize the appearance of the planned route by selecting a route line color and width.
- **Error Handling:** The application handles errors and provides informative error messages to the user.
- **Clear All Markers:** For user convenience, there is a "Clear All Markers" button that removes all markers from the map.
- **Geolocation Button:** A geolocation button is available for users to center the map on their current location.
- **Random Marker Orientation:** Placed markers have a touch of whimsy as they are randomly tilted by 10 degrees in either a positive or negative direction, adding a playful element to the map.
- **Fullscreen Mode:** Users can expand the map to full-screen mode with a dedicated button, providing an immersive mapping experience.
